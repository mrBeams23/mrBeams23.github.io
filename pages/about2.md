Hi I’m a third year computer science student that has a great interest in the field of cyber security and Infosec. 

I created this blog in order to create some documentation for skills and workflows that I already have. As well as displaying projects that I’m working on and share them to the larger security community. 

If your interested in contacting me or have a question or suggestion about one of my posts reach out to me over the wire at
